    <dialog>
        <h2>Hello Dialog</h2>
        <p>This is my first dialog</p>
    </dialog>
    
    <h1>What is a modal?</h1>
    <p>
        A modal is a pop up that appears on top of the page.
        A modal, as a pop up, takes the focus away from the 
        current page, and <u>takes priority over the page content.</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        When the modal does not take focus away from the page,
        we call it a dialog. In fact, HTML spec provides the dialog tag,
        as a way we can introduce modal dialogs to our pages.
    </p>
    <p>Again, modal takes focus away from the page, and dialog does not take focus away,
        although it still does pop up on top of the page. Also, in most cases,
        with a modal, you can scroll the page behind the modal but the modal itself will not move.
        While the dialog will move with the page. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We can easily say, a modal is not part of the page, 
        while a dialog, even as a popup, is a part of the page content.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this tutorial, we will be demonstrating how a modal and a dialog operate.
        <hr />
        Like we said earlier, the html specification provides us with the <em>dialog</em> 
        tag to achieve modals and dialogs. <br />
        And what it is, is a fancy div tag.. since you can put anything inside it
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, the way a dialog tag works is that it is always hidden. If you want it 
        to show on the page, you need to include the <em>open</em> attribute
    </p>
    <p>
        We will use javascript to interact and control the dialog element.
        Maybe to show what happens when a button is clicked!
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to show it as a non modal dialog, we just call show on it, and 
        to close it we just call close on it.

            if (i % 2 == 0) { 
                dialog.show(); // show opens the dialog as a non-modal
                btnDialog.textContent = "dialog: close"
            } else {
                dialog.close();
                btnDialog.textContent = "dialog: open"

        const btnModal = document.querySelector('.btnModal');
        btnModal.onclick = (event) => {
            // create a button inside the modal for closing

            btn.onclick = (event) => {
                dialog.close();

                dialog.removeChild(btn);
